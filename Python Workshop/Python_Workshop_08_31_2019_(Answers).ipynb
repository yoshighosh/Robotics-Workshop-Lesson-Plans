IF statements lets you choose specifically when to run the code. To write an IF Statement, you type **```if (some conditional):```**. This translates to *If true, perform task*. This runs anything in the loop, only if the conditional is True. To write things into the loops, we indent the block of code in the loop by one indent, so Python knows that this is what to run if the conditional is true. With IF Statements, we can write ELIF or ELSE Staements. ELIF, **```elif (some conditional):```**, goes after an IF Statement, and it means *else if this is true, perform task*, while ELSE, **```else:```**, goes at the very end to say *else, perform task*. It is important to note, you do not need to use ELIF or ELSE when using IF, but you cannot use them without using IF first. \n",

        "Prime numbers are numbers that have no factors other than the number itself, and 1. There are many ways to find prime numbers, but today we will be focusing on the Sieve of Eratosthenes. In short, to find the prime numbers, it finds all the numbers that are not prime, and deletes them from the list.

From there, find a way to calculate all non prime numbers, and set their boolean equal to False. Once all non prime numbers have been marked False, print out all the prime numbers by printing the index value of True booleans, then adding one. If you need help, we will be going over it together as a class.\n"
